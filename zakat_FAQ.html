                    Zakat is obligatory for every adult Muslim (baligh) who possesses wealth above the Nisab (minimum threshold) and has held it for one lunar year. The individual must be sane and own wealth that exceeds basic needs.

            <!-- FAQ 8 -->
			<div class="mb-6">
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">8. When is Zakat due?</h3>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					Zakat is due once a lunar year has passed on wealth that meets or exceeds the Nisab (minimum threshold) for a full lunar year. To explain this better, let’s walk through an example:
				</p>

				<h4 class="mt-4 text-lg font-semibold">Example: Starting Zakat Today</h4>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					Let’s say you decide to start paying Zakat today (September 23, 2024). Here are the steps you’d follow to determine when to pay Zakat:
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 1: Establish Your Zakat Due Date (Hawl)</h5>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					Zakat operates on the Hawl, which is a full lunar year (about 354 days). You need to fix the starting date on which you begin tracking your wealth. Let’s assume you start today, on September 23, 2024 (which is Rabi' al-Thani 9, 1446 AH in the Islamic calendar).
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 2: Check the Nisab</h5>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					The Nisab is the threshold of wealth that makes Zakat obligatory. For gold, it’s 87.48 grams, and for silver, it’s 612.36 grams. Alternatively, some scholars recommend using a monetary equivalent of either.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					For example, if you have savings, investments, and gold, you need to calculate the total amount of wealth in today's value and see if it exceeds the Nisab.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					If your wealth exceeds the Nisab on September 23, 2024, then the countdown for the lunar year begins from that date. If your wealth is below the Nisab, you wait until it exceeds the threshold and mark that as your Zakat date.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 3: Maintain Your Wealth Over One Lunar Year</h5>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					If your wealth stays above the Nisab for a full lunar year, Zakat becomes due at the end of the lunar year.
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					Your lunar year would end around September 11, 2025 (roughly 354 days later, corresponding to Rabi' al-Thani 1, 1447 AH).
				</p>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					At that time, you will calculate all of your eligible wealth (savings, investments, gold, etc.) and pay 2.5% of it as Zakat.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 4: Calculation at the End of the Lunar Year</h5>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					On September 11, 2025, you will calculate your total wealth. This includes:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700">
					<li>Cash savings</li>
					<li>Business income</li>
					<li>Gold, silver</li>
					<li>Investments (stocks, mutual funds, etc.)</li>
					<li>Any outstanding loans that you expect to receive</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					If the total still exceeds the Nisab, you must pay 2.5% of that total as Zakat.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Step 5: Paying Zakat</h5>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					Zakat can be paid anytime after the lunar year has completed, and it's recommended to pay as soon as possible. Some people prefer paying during Ramadan for added blessings, but this is not a requirement. You can also choose to pay Zakat in installments throughout the year as long as the full amount is paid.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Example Breakdown</h5>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
					<strong>Starting date:</strong> September 23, 2024 (Rabi' al-Thani 9, 1446 AH)<br>
					<strong>Lunar year end:</strong> September 11, 2025 (Rabi' al-Thani 1, 1447 AH)<br>
					<strong>Amount to pay:</strong> 2.5% of your wealth at the end of the year, provided it’s above the Nisab.
				</p>

				<h5 class="mt-4 font-semibold">Things to Check:</h5>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside mt-2 text-gray-700">
					<li>Ensure that your wealth has stayed above the Nisab for the full lunar year.</li>
					<li>Calculate the Zakat accurately by considering your savings, gold, business assets, etc.</li>
					<li>Make sure you pay it promptly after the lunar year ends.</li>
				</ul>

                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold">9. Can Zakat be paid in installments?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700">
                    Yes, Zakat can be paid in installments as long as the full amount is paid within the lunar year. It is recommended, however, to pay it all at once if possible to meet the immediate needs of the recipients.
