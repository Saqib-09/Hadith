            <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">1. What is the significance of sacrifice on Eid ul-Adha?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-900 pl-6">
                    The sacrifice on Eid ul-Adha commemorates the willingness of Prophet Ibrahim (AS) to sacrifice his son Ismail (AS) in obedience to Allah’s command. It is an act of devotion, symbolizing submission to Allah's will.

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
                    Sacrifice is obligatory (wajib) for every adult Muslim who meets the Nisab (minimum wealth threshold), similar to Zakat. If a person has enough wealth, they are required to offer a sacrifice during Eid ul-Adha.

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
                    Eligible animals for sacrifice include sheep, goats (at least one year old), cows or bulls (at least two years old), and camels (at least five years old). The animal must be healthy and free from defects.

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
                    The sacrifice is performed by slaughtering the animal humanely, with the name of Allah (Bismillah, Allahu Akbar) being pronounced. The animal’s throat is cut swiftly to ensure a quick death, minimizing suffering.

                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
                    Those intending to perform the sacrifice are advised to refrain from cutting their hair, nails, or any part of the body from the 1st of Dhul-Hijjah until the sacrifice is completed. This is a recommended Sunnah.

            <!-- FAQ 9 -->
			<div class="mb-6">
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">9. Can a non-working woman or a working woman offer sacrifice even if her husband intends to perform it?</h3>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
					In the Hanafi school, if a woman (whether working or non-working) meets the Nisab value, she is individually obligated to perform the sacrifice, even if her husband is offering one for the family. The sacrifice obligation is based on wealth ownership, and each person above the Nisab must offer their own sacrifice.
					<br><br>
					However, in the Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools, one sacrifice from the head of the household suffices for the whole family, but if the woman wishes, she may still perform her own sacrifice. The obligation is not as strict in these schools, where Qurbani is **Sunnah Mu'akkadah** (highly recommended).

            <!-- FAQ 10 -->
			<div class="mb-6">
				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">10. If a non-working woman does not offer sacrifice even though she meets the Nisab value, is she sinful?</h3>
				<p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
					According to the Hanafi school, if a non-working woman possesses wealth above the Nisab and does not perform the sacrifice without a valid excuse, she may be considered sinful. This is because Qurbani is wajib (obligatory) for those who meet the Nisab, regardless of their employment status.
					However, in the Shafi'i, Maliki, and Hanbali schools of thought, Qurbani is Sunnah Mu'akkadah (highly recommended), and while it is strongly encouraged, it is not considered sinful if missed.

            <!-- FAQ 11 -->
            <div class="mb-6">
                <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-blue-600">11. If a family has multiple members who all meet the Nisab value, do all of them need to offer a sacrifice?</h3>
                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700 pl-6">
                    According to the Hanafi school, each individual above the Nisab must offer their own sacrifice. However, the other schools (Shafi'i, Maliki, Hanbali) permit one sacrifice per family, though individuals may perform their own if they wish.
